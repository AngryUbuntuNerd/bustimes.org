## What's this?

It's [a thing about buses](https://bustimes.org.uk/).

## Installing

A database supported by GeoDjango is required â€“ I use PostgreSQL with PostGIS.

I host the production website on a single Linode server. [config/provision.sh](config/provision.sh) encapsulates most of the necessary steps for setting one up. It, among other things:

- sets the timezone
- sets the hostname
- adds a `josh` user
- changes some SSH settings
  - disables root login
  - disables password authentication
  - adds my public key
- installs Git, Nginx, Postfix, Postgres, etc
- clones this repository
- creates a virtualenv environment and installs the required Python modules:

  ```
  vitualenv env
  . env/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

In an emergency, it's possible to run this on Heroku, but that's relatively expensive, and things like the data import script (see below) expect a persistent file system.

## Importing data

[`import.sh`](data/import.sh) will download data from various [sources](https://bustimes.org.uk/data) and run the necessary Django [management commands](busstops/management/commands) to import it.
When run repeatedly, it will only download and import the stuff that's changed.
It expects to be run from the [`data`](data) directory, and needs a username and password to import TNDS data.
