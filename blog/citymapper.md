Thoughts on Citymapper


I quite like Citymapper.
It's what I use whenever I'm in London.
(bustimes.org is not very London-centric, partly because Citymapper and so many other great alternatives exist.)

This week, Citymapper have launched in some new places in the UK, like Nottingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Liverpool, Yorkshire, Glasgow, and Edinburgh.
Good for them.


Bustimes.
Millions of venture capital dollars well spent.
